 ## What is this?
 
 POGGERS! ADDONS! YEET! This is simply a repository for all the public addons available for Artemis. Since there's no apparent reason to not disclose 
 the source code, I've got ahead and made it public. Feel free to inspire yourself, though no skidding!
 
 As per due to several anticheats going as far as taking things a **bit too seriously**, I regret to inform you this is simply a "public source" and that
 by legal standing (I think?), you are not authorised to copy paste code. Idk, not a lawyer. Why you may ask? The reasoning's simple: I hate it when people
 get doxed, cracked  and so and forth for "skidding" code and whatnot. If you want to put yourself and your reputation at risk, go for it, nothing good will 
 come out of such a decision.
 
 Anywhom, love you all. Keep doing cool stuff. If you make an addon, feel free to add it here. It's awesome seeing the community build things together!
